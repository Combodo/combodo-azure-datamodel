# Extension Data model for Microsoft Azure

## About

This extension allows you to integrate Microsoft Azure environments within iTop. It adds to your iTop datamodel classes of objects that
modelize main Azure objects contained in subscriptions and resource groups, like virtual machines, network components, databases, apps...

If properly documented, these objects will help people in charge of the change process of you company to better understand the real impact
that a modification may have on you Azure infrastructure and the services that it delivers.

For an optimal usage, this extension should be used with the "Data collector for Microsoft Azure" that will automatically and regularly discover Azure
objects in their environement and load them in iTop. This ETL will insure that your data are always up to date in iTop.

For more information about this module have a look at the
corresponding [extension documentation](https://store.itophub.io/en_US/products/combodo-azure-datamodel).

## Download

Release packages can be found on the [iTop Hub Store](https://store.itophub.io/en_US/taxons/all-extensions). This is the best way to get a
running package as those contains all the needed modules and stable code.

When downloading directly from GitHub (by cloning or downloading as zip) you will get potentially unstable code, and you will miss
additional modules.
